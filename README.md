# Refactoring

For this assignment, the goal was to improve the code provided to meet accessibility standards. In addition, in adherence to the scout rule, the structure of the coding was changed in order to provide a clearer and 'cleaner' look to the code.

I provided descriptions to the code to guide the reader through the changes made and the reasoning behind the adjustments.

In order to clean up the code, I moved and specified specific code to provide a more visual representation of the code. I moved around items to match the layout of the webpage, i.e. Header towards the top, a nav section following the header, and the body afterwards. Spaces were added and deleted to the code to provide a clearer visual of where one line began and ended.
