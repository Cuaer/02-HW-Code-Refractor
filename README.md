# Refactoring

For this assignment, the goal was to improve the code provided to meet accessibility standards. In addition, in adherence to the scout rule, the structure of the coding was changed in order to provide a clearer and 'cleaner' look to the code.

I provided alternative text to images and setup the webpage to resemble the structure of an essay with a head, header, body, paragraphs, and footer.

In order to clean up the code, I created spaces between different sections of the code. In addition, I renamed 'div' descriptors to 'section' to improve the semantics of the code. I moved around items to match the layout of the webpage, i.e. Header towards the top, a nav section following the header, and the body afterwards. Spaces were added and deleted to the code to provide a clearer visual of where one line began and ended.
